bio: |
  Iâ€™m an SRE / Cloud Engineer & Architect / Senior Software Engineer working in financial services specialising in cloud engineering, big data stream processing and DevOps. Once upon a time I was a military helicopter pilot but at some point I grew up and decided to get a proper job; I've just got pictures of that life now, some of which are scattered around this website.
